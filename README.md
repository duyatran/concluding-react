## M08W21: Concluding React

### What's next for our React journey?
- Go through the entire [react.dev 's "Learn React" page](https://react.dev/learn) page. Read all pages closely, do the challenges. Completing it gives you a much better understanding of the React mental model and all common built-in hooks, best practices, and real-world usage patterns and gotchas.
- Read [this article](https://dev.to/reedbarger/the-react-roadmap-for-2024-1g24) to get a background on the current React ecosystem. Besides ecosystem evolution that is not specific to React (e.g. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) replacing `create-react-app`), specific React libraries that are in vogue change all the time, but this articles summarizes well the main concerns that are often addressed by external dependencies. Except for maybe routing, all others are optional for smaller apps.
  - Routing (e.g. React Router)
  - Fetching data (e.g. TanStack Query)
  - Client state management (e.g. Redux, Zustand)
  - Styling (e.g. utility-first like TailwindCSS, full-fledged component library like Material UI)
  - Forms (e.g. Formik is popular but unmaintained, React Hook Form is a modern alternative)
- Be aware of the current front-end trends of rendering earlier and more frequently on the server side, and the React's ecosystem shifting towards a full-stack framework (Next.js, React Server Components).
- Actually build apps that you care about, no need to go through all the tutorials first. Learn by solving the problems you actually have while building something is the best way to learn!
